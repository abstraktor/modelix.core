The `light-model-client` is designed to connect to either an MPS instance or a Modelix `model-server`.
It is implemented in Kotlin multi-platform so that it can also be run in the browser.


// TODO: correct link to advanced model client
While the alternative "advanced model client" provides more features and should be used for long-running processes, the `light-model-client` is optimized for a lower resource consumption and short living processes like in a browser tab.
The server is responsible for resolving conflicts and to keep the client side model in a valid state.

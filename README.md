## Development

### Commit convention

This project uses [conventional commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as the convention for Git commits.

### pre-commit

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to validate that new commits follow intended conventions.
To enable pre-commit hooks, you have to run the following command initially after cloning the repository:

```console
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
